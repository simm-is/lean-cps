# partial-cps

A lightweight Clojure/ClojureScript library for continuation-passing style (CPS) transformations derived from [await-cps](https://github.com/mszajna/await-cps). The CPS transform rewrites code similar to manual callback implementations by invoking the callback (continuation) only where necessary (at a breakpoint). This approach leaves the remaining code synchronous and therefore retains readability compared to the transformations in [core.async](https://github.com/clojure/core.async) or [cloroutine](https://github.com/leonoel/cloroutine). 

The transformed code is also generally faster, both in synchronous sections and when dispatching into callbacks. It does not provide any processing or scheduling framework, instead using safe trampolining execution. This avoids scheduling overhead and only hits a threadpool dispatcher or JS event loop if the effect handler explicitly schedules it.

## Features

- **Async/Await**: Write asynchronous code that looks synchronous
- **Async Sequences**: Lazy async sequences with transducer support
- **Custom Coroutines**: Build your own control flow primitives with breakpoints
- **Cross-platform**: Works seamlessly with both Clojure and ClojureScript
- **Lightweight**: Minimal dependencies and overhead
- **Fast**: No scheduling overhead, synchronous code stays synchronous
- **Safe**: Automatic trampolining prevents stack overflow

## Installation

### deps.edn
```clojure
{is.simm/partial-cps {:git/url "https://github.com/simm-is/partial-cps" :git/sha "LATEST"}} ; Check github for latest commit
```

## Usage

### Basic Async/Await

```clojure
(require '[is.simm.partial-cps.async :refer [async await]])

;; Define an async function
(def fetch-user
  (async
    (let [user-data (await (http-get "/api/user"))
          profile (await (http-get (str "/api/profile/" (:id user-data))))]
      (merge user-data profile))))

;; Run the async function with callbacks
(fetch-user
 (fn [result] (println "Success:" result))
 (fn [error] (println "Error:" error)))
```

### Error Handling

Errors propagate naturally through the async chain:

```clojure
(def safe-operation
  (async
    (try
      (let [result (await risky-operation)]
        (process result))
      (catch Exception e
        (println "Caught error:" (ex-message e))
        :fallback-value))))

;; Errors can also be handled in the error callback
(safe-operation
  (fn [result] (println "Got result:" result))
  (fn [error] 
    (log-error error)
    (handle-recovery error)))
```

### Async Control Flow

The library provides async versions of common control flow constructs:

```clojure
(require '[is.simm.partial-cps.async :refer [doseq-async dotimes-async]])

;; Process items sequentially with async operations
(async
  (doseq-async [item (await fetch-items)]
    (println "Processing:" item)
    (await (process-item item))))

;; Async iterations
(async
  (dotimes-async [i 5]
    (println "Iteration" i)
    (await (delay-ms 1000))))
```

### Async Sequences

Work with lazy, asynchronous data streams using transducers:

```clojure
(require '[is.simm.partial-cps.sequence :as seq])

;; Define an async sequence
(defrecord AsyncRange [start end]
  seq/IAsyncSeq
  (-afirst [_] 
    (async 
      (when (< start end)
        start)))
  (-arest [_]
    (async
      (when (< start end)
        (->AsyncRange (inc start) end)))))

;; Use transducers with async sequences
(async
  (let [async-seq (->AsyncRange 0 100)]
    ;; Eagerly process with transduce
    (let [sum (await (seq/transduce (map inc) + 0 async-seq))]
      (println "Sum:" sum))
    
    ;; Lazily transform with sequence
    (let [transformed (seq/sequence 
                        (comp (filter even?) 
                              (map #(* % 2))
                              (take 5)) 
                        async-seq)
          result (await (seq/into [] transformed))]
      (println "Transformed:" result))))
```

### Integration with Promises (ClojureScript)

```clojure
;; Convert JS Promise to CPS
(defn promise->cps [promise]
  (fn [resolve reject]
    (.then promise resolve reject)))

(async
  (let [response (await (promise->cps (js/fetch "/api/data")))
        data (await (promise->cps (.json response)))]
    (process-data data)))
```

### Node.js Callback Integration

```clojure
;; Convert Node.js-style callbacks
(defn node-callback->cps [f & args]
  (fn [resolve reject]
    (apply f (concat args 
                    [(fn [err result]
                       (if err
                         (reject err)
                         (resolve result)))]))))

(async
  (let [file-content (await (node-callback->cps fs/readFile "file.txt" "utf8"))]
    (println "File contents:" file-content)))
```

## Advanced Usage

### Creating Custom Breakpoints

Build your own control flow primitives:

```clojure
(def ^:no-doc breakpoints
  {`my-breakpoint `my-handler})

#?(:clj
   (defmacro my-cps
     "Defines a function that takes a successful and exceptional continuation,
   and runs the body, suspending execution whenever any of the breakpoints is
   encountered, and eventually calling one of the continuations with the
   result.

   A call of the form (breakpoint args..) is forwarded to the corresponding handler
   (handler succ exc args..), which is expected to eventually call either succ
   with the value or exc with exception to substitute the original call result
   and resuming the execution."
     [& body]
     (let [r (gensym) e (gensym)
           params {:r r :e e :env &env :breakpoints breakpoints}
           expanded (try
                      (macroexpand-all (cons 'do body))
                      (catch Exception e
                        (throw e)))]
       `(fn [~r ~e]
          (try
            (loop [result# ~(invert params expanded)]
              (if (instance? is.simm.partial_cps.runtime.Thunk result#)
                ;; If continuation returns a thunk, trampoline it
                (recur ((.-f ^is.simm.partial_cps.runtime.Thunk result#)))
                result#))
            (catch ~(if (:js-globals &env) :default `Throwable) t# (~e t#)))))))

;; Define a custom handler
(defn my-handler [env r e]
  (fn [args]
    `(schedule-microtask 
       (fn [] (~r ~(first args))))))

;; Create a coroutine with custom breakpoint
(def my-coroutine
  (my-cps
    (let [i 3]
      (println "Before yield" i)
      (my-yield i)
      (println "After yield" i))))

(my-coroutine
  (fn [result] (println "Done"))
  (fn [error] (println "Error:" error)))
```

### Performance Characteristics

The library is designed for high performance:

- **Minimal transformation**: Only rewrites code at breakpoint points
- **No scheduling overhead**: Direct callback execution unless you add scheduling
- **Safe trampolining**: Prevents stack overflow while maintaining speed
- **Synchronous fast path**: Non-async code runs at full speed

## Testing

The library integrates well with standard test frameworks:

```clojure
(require '[clojure.test :refer [deftest testing is] :as test]
         '[is.simm.partial-cps.async :refer [async await]])

;; Clojure test
(deftest my-async-test
  (testing "async operations"
    (let [result (atom nil)]
      ((async
         (reset! result (await some-async-op)))
       (fn [_] (is (= @result expected)))
       (fn [err] (is false "Should not fail"))))))

;; ClojureScript test
(deftest my-async-test
  (testing "async operations"
    (test/async done  ; test.async pattern
      ((async
         (let [result (await some-async-op)]
           (is (= result expected))))
       (fn [_] (done))
       (fn [err] 
         (is false "Should not fail")
         (done))))))
```
